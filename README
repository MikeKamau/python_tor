PURPOSE OF THE SCRIPT
======================
This code snippet is for use in accessing internet resources with python via the tor network.

REQUIREMENTS
======================
To use it, you must first off install the tor daemon and ensure that it is up and running and the pysocks python module is installed 
e.g. for debian and ubuntu users you can use the following commands:

apt-get update       #This updates your package lists from the repositories so you get the latest version of software packages
apt-get install tor	#This installs the tor daemon/service
service tor start		#This starts up the tor daemon
service tor status	#This is to check that tor is up and running
pip install pysocks	#This installs the pysocks python module
